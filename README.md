# CNN  For Image Classification

This repository has all the code and report for my CNN For Image Classification Project.

## Image Classification Project: Using the data provided by the professor to predict whether it is a cat or a dog

### 1. Installations

This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

- tensorflow.keras

- tensorflow.keras.preprocessing

- tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image

- numpy

- matplotlib

### 2. Project Motivation

 In this project, I use the data to  answer a question:

  -  Could the data provided, predict whether it is a cat or a dog?

  To answer the above the question, I created  model for the data . 

  As a brief summary of my findings:

  - In this project, we used our own cnn network training based on Keras and the VGG16 convolutional 

    neural network model in Keras to train the data, and we found that the model obtained from the 

    training data of our own cnn network is not as accurate as the model obtained from the training data 

    of VGG16, and the accuracy of our own trained model is between 70%-80%, while the accuracy of 

    VGG16 is over 95%. The accuracy of the self-trained model is in the range of 70%-80%, while that of 

    VGG16 is more than 95%.

 ### 3. File Descriptions

   This project contains 4 files. The report of my project is called 'CNN for Image Classification.ipynb'. The datasets are listed is in the files called .

### 4. Results

   The main findings of the code can be found at the post on Medium available [here][(https://medium.com/@Xiaoping2024/cnn-for-image-classification-9b661e237503))
